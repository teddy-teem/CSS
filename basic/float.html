                    Silibil'n'Brains commandeered the stage with the swagger of Americans who considered the audition beneath them. It was 2003 and the rappers were making their London debut at an industry showcase for unsigned talent. Freestyling in rhyme, the pair tore through their routine - part Eminem, part skater-boy punk - ripping off T-shirts to reveal lacy bras before leaping into the crowd. In a line-up stiff with tepid R&B acts, the Californians couldn't fail to steal the show. An A&R man in the audience from Island Records wanted to see them the very next day.
                    Brains - aka Gavin Bain - still feels his heart race when he describes Island's office full of A&R men the following day. "We go round everyone in the room, taking the piss, and they're all like, uh-oh, what are these crazy American kids going to do now?" The pair tease an overweight executive about his girth, and when a member of the boy band Busted walks by, they mock his songs and advise him to shave his monobrow. "And everyone laughs! We're rapping to the point where we don't even know what the fuck's coming out of our mouths, but people are just, like, laughing, loving everything we do."
